# Machine learning

We will spend the rest of class learning 
1. how to build a prediction model
1. how to optimize a prediction model
1. making that work with real world (messy!) data

1. EDA. Remember: ONLY do EDA on the training sample (never on the holdout sample)
    - `ydata-profiling` is great with two caveats: can be slow, generic insights
    - `dabl` is great - will suggest cleaning options and help see likely drivers of good models, and will even BUILD a starter model for you. But: BLACK BOX! And Caveat: It doesn't do CV.

## Notes and Vocab

You can take notes here if you want. I'll get you started:
- pipeline
- estimator
- transformer
- fit
